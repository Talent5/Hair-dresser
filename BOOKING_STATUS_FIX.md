// Simple booking status flow documentation and example

## ðŸ“‹ **Fixed Booking Status Flow**

The booking status has been updated to allow more flexible transitions:

### **Valid Status Transitions:**

1. **Quick Flow (For simple bookings):**
   ```
   pending â†’ accepted â†’ completed âœ…
   ```

2. **Standard Flow:**
   ```
   pending â†’ accepted â†’ confirmed â†’ completed âœ…
   ```

3. **Detailed Flow (For complex bookings):**
   ```
   pending â†’ accepted â†’ confirmed â†’ in_progress â†’ completed âœ…
   ```

### **All Valid Transitions:**
- **pending** â†’ accepted, rejected, confirmed, cancelled
- **pending_approval** â†’ accepted, rejected, confirmed, cancelled
- **accepted** â†’ confirmed, in_progress, **completed**, cancelled, no_show, stylist_no_show
- **confirmed** â†’ in_progress, **completed**, cancelled, no_show, stylist_no_show
- **in_progress** â†’ completed, cancelled
- **completed** â†’ (terminal state)
- **cancelled** â†’ (terminal state)
- **rejected** â†’ (terminal state)
- **no_show** â†’ (terminal state)
- **stylist_no_show** â†’ (terminal state)

### **What Was Fixed:**
The error "Invalid status transition from accepted to completed" has been resolved by adding 'completed' as a valid transition from both 'accepted' and 'confirmed' states.

### **Rating System Integration:**
When a booking status changes to 'completed':
1. âœ… Completion timestamp is recorded
2. âœ… Rating request notification is sent to customer
3. âœ… Customer can now submit a rating for the service
4. âœ… Stylist receives feedback to improve services

### **How to Test:**
1. Create a booking with status 'accepted'
2. Update status to 'completed' via API or admin dashboard
3. Verify customer receives rating request notification
4. Customer can submit rating through mobile app

### **API Endpoint:**
```javascript
PATCH /api/bookings/:bookingId/status
{
  "status": "completed",
  "completionNotes": "Service completed successfully",
  "actualDuration": 120
}
```

This fix ensures the rating system can be triggered properly when services are completed! ðŸŽ‰
